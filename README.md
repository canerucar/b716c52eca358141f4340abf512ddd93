This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Let's add the .env file to our page and add the necessary endpoint into it.

```bash
API_ENDPOINT = "https://example.com"
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

and let's run node api.js by going to cd app/services

```bash
cd app/services
node api.js
```

Then let's go to 

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
